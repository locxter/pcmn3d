## Overview

![Overview image](overview.jpeg)

This is a 3D remake of the classic arcade game Pacman using Unity, all built during my work placement at [ise](https://www.ise.de/). As this is my first (and probably only) Unity project, the code quality might not be on par with my other projects and it's very likely I didn't follow all (or even most) best practices of this toolset. Also note that this remake doesn't even nearly implement all the rules and mechanics of the original game, which despite its age is still a really advanced and intricate master piece. For the rules and mechanics it implements, I tried to be as close to the original as possible though.

## Dependencies

I generally try to minimize dependencies, but I'm a one man crew and can therefore only support Windows 10 as I ran that during development. Anyway, you need to have the following packages installed for everything to work properly:

- Unity 2022.3.3f1 as the game engine. Install it via the [isntallation guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingUnity.html).
- Visual Studio 2022 Community as the code editor. Install it via the [website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/community/).

## How to use it

Import it into a Unity 2022.3.3f1 instance and run it from there or simply take a look at [Releases](https://github.com/locxter/pcmn3d/releases) section.
